# SpringBootRecipeApp

Objectives:

To build an application using a ticketing system. A strong emphasis will be placed on working with branches to finish small and specific tasks.  The application is to have around 70-80% unit test coverage with TDD being implemented.  

A main objective will be to build a more complex data model with nested CRUD operations.  The data model should be mapped with relationships 1-to-1, 1-to-many/many-to-1 and many-to-many.
